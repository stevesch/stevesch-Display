This library wraps up TFT_eSPI for a number of boards and provides backbuffer-style display refreshing, i.e. like most games.
TFT setup uses DMA or multi-core copy when available, allowing for excellent frame rates on 
small TFT displays (loop times of 100+ fps on small displays like M5 StickC or StickC plus).


Simple example of backbuffered animation on (left-to-right) TTGO-TS, TTGO T-Display, M5StickC, M5StickC Plus:
