This library wraps up TFT_eSPI for a number of boards and provides backbuffer-style display refreshing, i.e. like most games.
TFT setup uses DMA or multi-core copy when available, allowing for excellent frame rates on small TFT displays (loop times of 100+ fps on small displays like M5 StickC or StickC plus).
